That is why the amendments tabled by that committee should quite definitely be adopted .
The objection that such programmes can only be disruptive given the current economic climate and unemployment level in many Member States is unacceptable and merely ridiculous .
For in addition to their environmental dimension , they can also have a substantial positive impact on the economy .
According to the Commission , apart from its effects on the quality of life , these savings would also have positive effects on employment .
Let me repeat that I deeply regret that the committee did not accept my proposal that we extricate ourselves from this unholy cooperation procedure and aim at a co-decision procedure .
It would have been more sensible for Parliament always to apply the co-decision procedure .
If we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
For that is the decisive point here .
I think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of Parliament .
Energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the European Union .
As far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in Rio .
We are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure .
Think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy .
Larger firms are , of course , aware of this .
If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
Since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries .
The energy / intensity use in most of the European Union is worsening .
That is unacceptable .
The SAVE I programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money .
It is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to SAVE II .
One would have hoped the lessons from SAVE I would be learnt . That is not so , as I shall explain later on .
One of the lessons from SAVE I was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which Member States have to enforce .
But that is not enough .
We know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers .
They have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance .
Let us look at the lessons .
Firstly , legislation is what works .
Secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them .
The target in SAVE II is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious .
I would like to see an indicative programme issued by the Commission and monitored throughout the Member States .
They help impoverished regions .
One area which must be emphasized above all is transport .
Transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil .
We have not done enough in that sector .
Then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the EU for the cooling of homes .
There is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread .
This makes us competitive , remember .
We need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them .
I am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the Council of Ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the SAVE II programme .
That is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
I think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the European Parliament representing people in every Member State .
That will is to say : ' Let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' .
That consensus has led to a number of common conclusions which I will not spell out in detail now .
However , it is worth pointing out once again that with this programme we are seeking to promote environmental improvement and to increase the competitiveness of Europe 's undertakings .
The Commission 's proposal to treble the resources for the SAVE II programme , as compared with the SAVE I programme , is certainly encouraging .
SAVE II endeavours to strengthening pilot actions that were undertaken in the first programme and also makes provision for new actions .
As has already been said , the programme ignores the positive results that have stemmed from legislative measures and the possibility of achieving a further increase in energy efficiency via the same route .
I would therefore advise the Commission to look for a middle way , so as to provide an impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , as I said before .
However , it would also be useful if the Commission were to take account of the need to achieve convergence between the Member States in the area of energy efficiency .
Mr President , I support Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's report .
She introduced it with her usual efficiency .
It is important that we support the continuation of the SAVE energy efficiency programme with a budget of ECU 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
The renewal of the SAVE programme may be timely as the European Commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % .
Indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere .
Between 1991 and 1994 the SAVE programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field .
It is important in this context that the SAVE initiatives should be coordinated with other European Union energy initiatives such as THERMIE and SYNERGY .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased first of all to compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report on SAVE II .
This report makes a contribution to the difficult but important battle for a sustainable environment and a sustainable development of our economy .
Liberals start with their own responsibility and do not shuffle it off on to succeeding generations .
That of course means that there must be sustainable management of natural resources .
There is a price-tag on pollution .
So the environmental costs of consumption and production must be made visible in the economy .
The Committee on Energy has approved 35 amendments , four of them from the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party .
I should like to explain two of them .
A shift , ladies and gentlemen , in the use of energy sources , in particular in the direction of renewable energy sources , could make these figures considerably more attractive .
That should be encouraged in the framework of SAVE II .
It is essential to apply modern energy technologies and to switch to cleaner industries in Eastern Europe .
That is good for the environment and good for the economy and benefits both the Union and third countries .
That is what makes this collaboration so significant .
Mr President , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a Nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
There is quite a lot of snow too .
In Finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
The directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker Mr Macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the Council .
We need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
I hope that this SAVE II programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it .
Parliament has stepped in and , correctly , pointed this out .
We do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
Let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
The most important thing we have done recently is to evaluate the SAVE programme .
We have done an excellent evaluation and have come up with the real result that you need legislative proposals .
We will not get the results we need .
We have to harmonize with other programmes .
We have to harmonize with THERMIE and SYNERGY and we have to export these ideas to third countries , particularly the East .
Where are the energy saving programmes for the Commission ?
Let us do some real work ourselves on our own buildings .
Buildings are shooting up here and in Brussels .
Where are the real energy saving proposals there ?
We pontificate about what third countries and peripheral states should do all the time .
Let us do something real here in the heart of Europe where we have money .
Let us do it legislatively and with fiscal instruments .
I do not accept that we cannot use fiscal instruments .
It is about time we got back to using them .
It is something which is fairly obvious when you state it but clearly it has profound implications for the people who live in those climates .
In particular , the Scots should take a leaf out of the book of the Finns , the Swedes and the Norwegians on how to insulate their houses .
A lot of lessons could be learned by our people and these could be applied right across Europe to everybody 's benefit .
Do you believe the targets that you agreed to at Rio ?
SAVE I , which Parliament criticized for having insufficient finance and ambition , detailed 13 legal actions and standards that would be undertaken .
In practice , only four directives emerged and it is unacceptable that the present proposal makes no reference to the failure of SAVE I as a legislative programme .
For instance , we still have no directive on energy efficiency of buildings .
It is sad that the current proposal does not contain more ambitious targets for energy saving .
